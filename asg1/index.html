	<h1>Assignment</h1>

    <p>
		From the readings, I learned a lot about how web design came to be what it is today and where it'll possibly go in the future. I learned how back end vs front end differs but both changed drastically. The web became a software platform where new languages and other tools blossomed. I also learned when designing, design for something that'll be here to stay. There's room to be innovative and experiment. I also learned a bit about what different "techy" words meant.

		For this webpage, the goal is to have a space dedicated to all things plants. There would be places for people to insert the plant they have or are looking to buy and there will be information based on the goal. It will pull up nearby shops to buy plants and it will have tips and tricks for taking care of the plant. The webpage also have places where the plant parent can put in things they notice are wrong with the plant and the site will recommend what to do. There will aslo be options for farmers to trade seads and other features on the site. My main reason why I want to design this is just to have fun with the website designing rather than something super serious.
