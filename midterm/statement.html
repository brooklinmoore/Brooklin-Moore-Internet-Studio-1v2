    <h2>Design Statement</h2>

    <p>The rich and magical aesthetics of the Wizarding World inspired the visual and interaction design. I used a deep purple and gold color palette to represent the mystical atmosphere of Hogwarts. Parchment-style backgrounds give a timeless feeling, while bold headings with a serif font--IM Fell English SC--give the site an old-world magical tone. Body text uses Open Sans for readability and modern contrast.</p>
    <p>Certain Images were selected to showcase some of the most iconic elements of the Wizarding World: Hogwarts Castle, Quidditch matches, and magical creatures. Buttons have been designed in gold to contrast with the darker backgrounds and to follow through with the theme. The navigation menu and footer are easy to find on every page for the user, while CTAs such as 'Book Now' and 'Request Info' urge interaction.</p>
    <p>The website is designed to balance aesthetic appeal with readability, placing text with images on a clean and well-structured layout. The hero image on the home is meant to instantly sets the mood, bringing the visitor into the magical experience. Overall, the design immerses the user in the Wizarding World and encourages exploration of the vacation offerings.</p>
