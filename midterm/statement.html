    <h2>Design Statement</h2>

    <p>The visual and interaction design was inspired by the rich and magical aesthetic of the Wizarding World. I selected a deep purple and gold color palette to evoke the grandeur and mystical atmosphere of Hogwarts. Parchment-style backgrounds provide a timeless feel, while bold headings in a serif font (IM Fell English SC) give the site an old-world, magical tone. Body text uses Open Sans for readability and modern contrast.</p>

    <p>Images were carefully chosen to highlight iconic aspects of the Wizarding World: Hogwarts Castle, Quidditch matches, and magical creatures. Buttons were designed in gold to stand out against darker backgrounds and maintain a cohesive theme. The navigation menu and footer are consistent across all pages for easy user access, while CTAs like 'Book Now' and 'Request Info' encourage engagement.</p>

    <p>The layout balances aesthetic appeal with readability, placing text alongside images in a clean, structured way. The hero image on the homepage sets the mood immediately, drawing the visitor into the magical experience. Overall, the design immerses the user in the Wizarding World and encourages exploration of the vacation offerings.</p>
