    <h4>Do's and Don'ts of Web Design</h4>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">The Yale Schoool of Art</a> is without a doubt in violation of rule 6 (and possibly all the other rules).

    <h4>Better User Experience Through Storytelling</h4>
    <p>
        Framing my project in a story format can help fine-tune my ideas by forcing me to give my ideas structure by defining stages in my ideas. It focuses a “story” around the User as a protagonist and gives it a beginning, middle, and an end. This process can help me find the gaps and inconsistencies within my project, as well as redundancy in my thinking. By refocusing on the user in this story-like way, it helps me become more aware of their needs, conflicts, motivations, etc. This allows me to look outward in my creative process and not just focus on myself and what I think I need to put on the websites to make me happy. My design decisions would become more intentional and cohesive. Storytelling as a whole will act as a great way to critique my project, adding clarity and transforming ideas into user-centric solutions.

    <h4>Meet Your Type: A Field Guide to Love and Typography</h4>
    <p>
        Different ways to establish hierarchy in typography design are size, weight, color, space, position/alignment, typeface/selection, case, and italics/underlining. All of these methods establish a focal point and create a hierarchy based on the path our eye follows. 
    </p>
    <p>A good example of this typography and hiarcy is the <a href="https://www.jeton.com/">Jeton</a> website.</p>

    <h2>Creative Brief: Rooted</h2>

    <h4>Problem:</h4> 
  <p>
    New and experienced plant owners often struggle to find advice that's trustworthy when caring for a plant or crop. They have to deal with contradictory advice when looking online, with plant blogs, and even with the people who sell them plants and plant-related products. Finding retailers is also an issue, as well as trading seeds on social media groups, which becomes a complicated affair. The plant process as a whole leads to a lot of frustration, misdiagnosis, and dead plants.
  </p>

<h4>Audience:</h4>
<p><strong>Primary Audience: The New Plant Parent</strong></p>
  <p>Millennials & Gen Z, who have recently gotten into plant care. They have a few houseplants and are eager to learn, but often feel overwhelmed by the number of things to consider when taking care of a plant. They are tech-savvy, and they use their phones for quick answers. Their motivation is not to kill their new plant baby.</p>
<P><strong>Secondary Audience: The Seasoned Gardener</strong></P>
  <p>Experienced plant owners and community gardeners who have a deeper knowledge base. They are looking for rarer species of plant seeds, advanced tips, and a community of fellow enthusiasts. Their motivation is to trade seeds, share experience, and further their hobby.</p>

<h4>Compitition:</h4>
<p>
  <strong>Growinginthegarden and Agriearth</strong> are both strong competitors in the plant and e-commerce realm. They have a well-laid-out website for purchasing seeds, and they have blogs, recipes, and tips for planting. However, they are primarily focused on selling plants and outdoor gardening rather than being a well-rounded hub.
</p>
<p><strong>Reddit/ChatGPT/Google/Instagram</strong> are all powerful for community advice and diagnosis. There are lots of different tricks and videos that people can use to get quick information. Their weakness is that these can all become chaotic and hard to navigate. It also lacks the tools to make this the most reliable form of information.
</p> 

<h4>Key Messages:</h4>
<p>The Primary Message is that Rooted is the ultimate plant partner. No matter what stage a user is at in their plant journey, there’s something on the website to help along the way!</p>
<p>
  The Supporting Message is that Rooted simplifies the plant care process. There’s one place for all plant questions, needs, and purchases. It’s a one-stop shop to find a local plant community, trade seeds, and share your journey. All the information is expert and community-backed to help the users' plants thrive.
</p>

<h4>Call to Action:</h4>
<p>The CTA for a user is to be proactive in their plant journey and foster an environment where all people can feel comfortable in getting involved with planting, gardening, and farming/trading.</p>

<h3>How to Measure Success:</h3>
<p>Success would be measured by functionality and usability of the design rather than business metrics and sales. If a user can successfully navigate and use the website without confusion, that would be a success. Also, if it’s visually appealing and engaging as a website, that's a very important metric to consider when measuring success. It also needs to be logical as a website to avoid things that are out of place or missing within the user's story. This website should be one that can be used consistently and never loses its purpose. </p>
