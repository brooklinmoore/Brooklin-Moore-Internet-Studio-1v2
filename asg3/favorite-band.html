	They're my favorite band for a lot of reasons, but I'd go all the way back to my childhood. The eagles are one of those bands I heared growing up and never knew it. I knew many of their songs without knowing who the band is. When I got older I found one of their songs "One of These Nights" and it quickly became one of my favorite songs. Overall the way their music sounds its one of the few bands where I can actually hear the words they're saying, so I also appreciate that. Overall, they're such a well rounded well sounding band that I've always loved without knowing it.
