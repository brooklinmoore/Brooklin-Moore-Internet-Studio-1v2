            <h2>Advantages and Disadvantages of Sketching Wireframes</h2>
            <p>
                Sketching wireframes is quick and flexible, allowing for rapid exploration of ideas and iteration without being constrained by software tools. It encourages creativity, collaboration, and brainstorming, as team members can easily draw, modify, and annotate ideas. Sketching is also low-cost and requires minimal training.

            <p>
                Hand-drawn wireframes can be messy, less precise, and harder to share or present professionally. They may not scale well for complex projects and lack interactive features, making it difficult to simulate user flows or test functionality. Additionally, revisions may require redrawing, which can become time-consuming.

            <h2>Best Wireframing Style for the Project</h2>
            <p>
                For this gardening and seed trading project, low-fidelity sketch wireframes work best initially. Since the website covers multiple features like plant care guides, seed trading, and user accounts, sketching allows for rapid ideation of layouts, navigation, and content structure. This style supports early experimentation with page hierarchy and feature placement without committing to detailed visuals, making it easier to iterate and gather feedback before moving to high-fidelity wireframes or digital prototypes.
