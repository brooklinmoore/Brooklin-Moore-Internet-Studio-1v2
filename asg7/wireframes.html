            <h2>Advantages and Disadvantages of Sketching Wireframes over Wireframe Software:</h2>
            <h3>Advantages</h3>
            <p>
                The Advantages of creating digital wire frames rather than hand-drawn ones is how neat and organized it is. Digital wireframes enable designers to reuse specific templates and components, ensuring consistency across multiple screens. Digital tools can also help make the wireframing process much quicker and more efficient. This is even more useful when projects have multiple screens. Digital tools can help manage and make adjustments to that in a clearer manner. Another plus is that sharing the screens with other members of a team becomes far easier.            </p>
            <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
            <p>
                A large disadvantage to digital wireframing is the learning curve. Digital tools already have a steep learning curve as is, and having to figure it out with something that's supposed to be a less intense sketch is frustrating. Designers are also tempted to focus too much on details and precision early on, which takes away from designing an adequate structure and accomplishing usability goals. Another issue is that hand-drawn wireframing offers more creative liberties than digital wireframing due to restrictions someone might place on their ability to sketch fast on a piece of software.            </p>

            <h2>Best Wireframing Style for the Rooted</h2>
            <p>
                While I’ll likely end up making digital sketches for wireframing, I do think that first-hand sketching, quick less than low low-fidelity wireframes can be extremely beneficial due to the fact that I don't have a lot of experience with the websites and I have a lot of different screens. I think that after doing a few of those sketches, I’d go to a website to start making low-fidelity wireframes.
