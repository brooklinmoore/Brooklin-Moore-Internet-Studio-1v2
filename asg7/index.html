      <p>
        Rafiki from The Lion King would be a great ruler because of his maturity. His wisdom makes him capable of making difficult decisions and discerning what would be right for his people. His patience also helps with his ability to handle complex situations and complex people. This would help with political debates and negotiations as well. His understanding of the circle of life will make his ideas profound and well thought out. He understands the way the world operates and would be able to make rational, pattern-based decisions. As a spiritual guide, he possesses qualities that lead him to fairness and insight. On top of all of this, his humor and compassion for others would inspire loyalty and respect among his people.

      <h2>Running Mate: Zazu</h2>

      <p>
        Zazu would be a good running mate because of his organized manner. While Rafiki is a great spiritual leader, people may be put off by how down to earth and calm he is. Zazu on the other hand is a bit more animated, hyper organized, and strict. He’s like the anchor to Rafiki's wind, which offers a compelling contrast that works well together. His immense attention to detail and overall knowledge or the order within the pride lands makes him both reliable and trustworthy. He’s extremely loyal and, while very cautious, his sense of duty would help keep any leader grounded and focused on what’s best for everyone.

      <h2>Campaign Platform</h2>
      <p>
        Rafiki's top campaign platform would focus on the unity throughout the kingdom through his wisdom. He would easily lead by example, being an encouragement to others to learn from their past mistakes and lean into the moments of life that teach lessons. Rafiki believes that true, honest strength comes from understanding yourself and living in balance with the people around you in order to minimize conflict and promote peace and harmony that is in reach. His leadership would center around guiding his people through reflection, growth, and connection to the circle of life. With Zazu as a running mate to help manage details and communication, Rafiki would bring an amazing approach to leadership.
