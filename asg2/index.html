    <h3>What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML?</h3>
    <p>
      The difference between structured content and semantic HTML is the way the content is delivered and the purpose of it. Sturcted content is delivered in chunks and focus on organizing information in a way thats reusable and defined. Semantic HTML however, is Web-spcific, so all of the tags already have meaning. Structured content is made for machines, while semantic HTML is made for the users.
    </p>
    <h3>How do they work together?</h3>
    <p>
      They work togehter by doing the seperate jobs the've been assigned coherently. Structured content is the consistant organized information while semantic HTML is the way to show the information/structure on the page through tags. 
    </p>
    <h3>Why is it important to have structured content and semantic HTML in your web pages?</h3>
    <p>
      It's important to have both structured content and semantic HTML in webpages because they both serve different, yet crucial jobs. They go into Accesibility for different groups of people. Search engine optimization, being readable, and maintaining the site as a whole. They both inmapct the results of the Webpage and are both very important.

  <h2>Required Readings Questions</h2>
  <h5>Banishing Your Inner Critic</h5>
  <p>
For me, mindfulness and meditation is the best way for me to silance my inner critic. I'm a very religous person, so the way I approach most of problems is the same. I pray about it and I read on scripture that I know relate to my feelings. It helps to ground me and makes me feel aware of how I'm feeling and helps me distinguish whats true and whats juse feelings from my inner critic critiquing me. While I do that now I'd like to incorperate it into little things more as well. I akso tend to externalize the critic as well and its helpful creating that distance.

  <h5>Procrastination</h5>
  <p>
    Hyperbolic discounting refers to the cognitivie bias where rthe value of a reward is decreced the further away in time that it is. An example of this is if you scrolled on instagram instead of studying for a quiz because instagram gived you an instant reward. This leads to scrambling later when needing to study because the reward value of studying is now increced since the quiz is coming up. One method McRaney recommends to counter this that I like and use sometimes is reward substitution. It gives me a reward sooner so there's now motivation to do my work.

  <h5>Critical Web Design: Ch. 1 Networks</h5>
  <p>
    I have very little network making power all of this is very new to me; however, the one I'm the most confident in now is networking power. Determining who and what is included and colelcting that I think is my strong suit.
