      <h2>White Hat</h2>
      <p>We discussed how Rooted identifies a gap in the plant care market. The target audience is both new and seasoned gardeners, but it is a concern that the needs of the groups would be drastically different. It could lead to the expectations of the site being skewed. From an informational standpoint, the concept is well thought out. Also, logically, the site might be slow because of the number of things on the site, causing issues with usability.
      </p>

      <h2>Red Hat</h2>
      <p>We felt like the impression of the website initially is that it seems inviting; however, it might be overly ambitious. We feel like new users might be overwhelmed with the amount of information if it’s not organized properly, which also might pose an issue in the future. The idea of one place for everything seems a bit out of my reach. It could cause the same chaos that's present on apps that are suffocated, like Reddit.
      </p>

      
      <h2>Black Hat</h2>
      <p>We deduced that Rooted's biggest threat is the fact that it’s such a large task. It tries to combine a lot of different things like educating, e-commerce, and community trading. It could be oversaturated, and it could dilute the quality of the information. Without expert moderation, community advice might contradict professional info they’ve heard elsewhere, which would break credibility in the site. There are also concerns with legal issues when it comes to plant trading.
      </p>

      <h2>Yellow Hat</h2>
      <p>We talked about, regardless of the challenges there might be, there’s a clear demand for a reliable resource such as this one. This website's idea would merge experts and the community. With the way it's designed, it could stand out from its competitors. We think that combining the ideas into one makes the site unique, and it's a cool concept to have a one-stop shop. It’s both inclusive and encourages long-term engagement. If executed well, Rooted could become a trusted digital platform for plant enthusiasts.
      </p>

      <h2>Green Hat</h2>
      <p>We thought Rooted had strong potential to add something else to make the website stand out. We suggest adding visual diagnostics or calendars with interactive AI features. Maybe even a community aspect where people could nudge each other so that they can look after each other's plants. There could be features to compare with other plants at the same stage of growth, so users know what to expect or compare to discern what the plant needs.
      </p>

      <h2>Blue Hat</h2>
      <p>We talked about how Rooted might need a scheduled roadmap to plan what gets done and when. With a task as ambitious as this one, there’s definitely a need to have a properly scheduled timeline. Another thing is to prioritize core functions so that the important things are in the website first and foremost. The smart thing to do is start small, validate how well that part of the site is working, and then scale up. If Rooted keeps the vision for the website clear, it can avoid oversaturation and become the dependable website it aims to be.
      </p>

      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>As a result of this discussion, my project has shifted the focus from making sure to have a lot of cool features to making sure the most convenient features are listed on the website and truly fine-tune this experience to my users rather than myself, and what I think would be fun and/or interesting. I also realised that I need to make sure not to mislead the users into thinking that everything is failproof. While that would be the goal of the website, realistically, not all advice will fix a problem. I need to make it distinguishable from other sites while simultaneously making sure to not oversaturate my own website to the point that its not even usable.
