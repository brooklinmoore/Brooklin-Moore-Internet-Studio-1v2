        <h2>My Ideal Career Path</h2>
        <p>
            My ideal job is one that allows me to blend creativity, research, strategy, and problem-solving. 
            I love understanding how people think and interact with digital products, and UX gives me the 
            perfect mix of psychology, design, and technology. I want a role where I can keep growing, 
            work with different teams, and mend digital experiences to really help people. 
            I’m drawn to positions that allow for both hands-on research and
            strategy, because I enjoy connecting ideas to physical decisions.
