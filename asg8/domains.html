                In my discussion with my classmate, we talked about how important it was to choose a name that is both reachable and reflects a bit of my call to action. All in all, I wanted the name to have modern relevance and a deeper meaning behind it. We wanted something that captured the biblical idea of being firmly grounded (rooted) in Christ while also sounding approachable to a wide audience, regardless of religious background. We brainstormed different ideas that revolved around growth, being grounded, flourishing, bearing fruit, etc. We also talked about words that invoked an imagery of flourishing and not like possible past mistakes with plants, where they wither away. Together, we agreed that the name should not only sound good, but also convey the heart of the website.

                The domain name we liked the best is <strong>StayingRooted.com</strong> because it feels both modern and has a meaningful background. We knew we wanted the word 'rooted' because it talks about both the process of gardening and how plants use their roots to collect nourishment and become a flourishing organism, as well as tying to biblical imagery of getting nourishment from God. In John 15:5, Jesus says, “I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.” This phrase captures the same spiritual connection to plant imagery and growth, making <strong>StayingRooted.com</strong> a great fit for a website that will meet the purpose of plant care, but also honors God.
